# Ticketing_GUI_System_Java_SQL

<h2>Project Description</h2>
This project consists of a GUI Ticketing Booking System made from Java and SQL. I needed to integratea database component, implement design patterns, use GitHub for version control, and incorporate necessary unit tests. Additionally I applied OOP concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, while creating multiple classes with necessary relationships. I also needed to consider invalid responses from the user.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- Java 
- SQL

<h2>Environments Used</h2>

- Netbeans Version 14 JDK 11
- Apache Derby DB

<h2>Project Setup:</h2>
For this project, I started off by creating a story board to visualize my ideas and concepts. I needed to 
decide the logical order of all the various panels, ensuring the best possible user experience. 
Once I created my initial setup, I connected my project to GitHub allowing me to perform 
multiple commits for version control. I first created my TempoTicketsWebsite class, 
which includes the main, helping me visualize what was occurring in my code. Based on my 
ideas and objectives my class design was then created. While connecting my database, 
debugging statements were inserted to help me understand where any errors could occur. I 
created a number of panels, including HomePagePanel, BookingPage, ArtistPanel and more. 
Code became repetitive, so I re-evaluated my classes to decide on how to maximize my work 
efficiently. To utilize my code, I implemented object-oriented programming, including 
abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and an interface. Once I completed the 
program, I created tests cases all effectively testing my methods.
